                <p>
                    A fan project web game inspired by the <a href="https://www.amazon.com.au/Wheres-Sonic-Now/dp/0721425429">'Where's Sonic Now'</a> book by Ladybird UK.<br></br> I'm also a huge fan of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_%26_Knuckles">Sonic & Knuckles</a> game by Sega.  
                </p>
                <p>
                The game is not run for profit.<br></br> Images, artwork, music and sound effects have been accessed through <a href="https://archive.org/details/sonic3_knuckles_ost/48-Act+2+Boss+Theme.mp3">Internet Archive</a> as well as <a href="https://info.sonicretro.org/Where%27s_Sonic_Now%3F">Sonic Retro</a>.

                <p>
                    As a budding web developer I challenged myself to create a 'Where's Wally' style game with a timer and leaderboard.<br></br><br></br>
                    After some time thinking over the idea I recalled the 'Where's Sonic Now' and 'Where's Sonic' books from my childhood which the game levels are based upon.<br></br><br></br>
                    Being a Sonic game, having a timer to make things competitive like a race felt like it made sense!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Growing up with the original Sega Sonic games, this project was absolutely an excuse for a trip down nostalgia lane.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I hope you have as much fun playing through the levels as I did piecing this together! ‚úåüèª
